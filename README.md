# swiftui-coredata-newsreader-sample

This repository is, as most things in my profile, is me failing-in-public, and
learning some things along the way! As much as possible, Swift and Swift UI is
used.

For this particular repository, the goals are:

[ ] Provide an "experience" which provides news articles from an external API
and allows them to be navigated to and swiped away (marked as read)
[ ] Implement persistent storage using Core Data
[ ] Use data access patterns that allow for mutability as the app grows
[ ] Consider memory and performance, and make that reasonable to test
